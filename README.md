# Jovian-Bot

Jovian is a DialogFlow powered conversational chatbot developed to deliver information regarding latest government schemes and affiliated policies for public services. The NLP based conversational platform can be used to interact with the public, provide assistance with tasks, analyse sentiments and collect and analyze data to offer appropriate services

The project was started in April 2022 as a combined initiative by Ashwin & Gayathri, and has been licensed under the Eclipse Public License 2.0 . All PRs are maintained by Ashwin. Try interacting with Jovian deployed over Telegram here.

# SubDirectories and Deployment Platforms

### Files and Folders
**Intents:** This folder contains over 100+ intents that are used to categorize user intentions for each conversation turns.
<br>**Entities:** This subdirectory contains entities that are used to identify & extract specific data from end-user expressions.
<br>**agent.json** & **package.json** are inline editor file, & are not overwritten when importing/restoring the dialogflow agent

### Deployment Platforms

Direct end-user interactions are handled by Dialogflow in a platform-specific way. Currently, Jovian is integrated only with text based platforms like Telegram and Messenger. These integrations are fully supported by Dialogflow and are configured with the Dialogflow Console. Dialogflow phone Gateway and a variety of other partner built-in telephony integrations are  currently under alpha/beta testing and are scheduled to be made available in the upcoming version.

# Usage, Development and Privacy Policy

To invoke this bot, the user can simply start with a greeting, or a query. The action is set to match the user's language settings. The default welcome intents usually includes a short description of the services that Jovian can deliver. Quick replies, and card responses are available for the Telegram deployment of the bot for user convenience. Dialogflow API requests and responses are logged to Cloud Logging. As per the privacy policy, the users data is totally secure and no maintainer has any access over the messages that the user may send to the action or the responses that it sends back

Interaction logs capture conversation messages from both end-users, and the agent. This user information may reside within the agent's logs stored by Dialogflow for upto 400 days. Interactions that had issues with intent matching show a warning icon in yellow and the interactions that had webhook errors show a warning icon in red. Usage data such as information regarding the number of users using the bot, the geographical regions they are located in, and basic data including usersâ€™ language preference, device type, and length & frequency of use can be accessed to make better bot. 

The privacy policy for the chatbot can be found here. Jovian does not require the users to sign up into new accounts (the third-parties may require signing up). No cloud functions provided by Firebase are used for developing this bot
